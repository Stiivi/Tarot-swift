# Tarot

An intertangled knowledge caputre system with multiple perspectives.

Tarot is a graph based knowledge codification system. It means that the
bits of knowledge are preserved in a non-linear inter-connected form. The core
structure is a _Graph Memory_ that represents a directed labelled multi-graph.
That means that the structure is composed of nodes and links between the nodes
and that both the nodes and links can have information associated with them.
Graph memory stores a dictionary of scalar attributes of few basic types.

Design principle:

- Every entity that represents the content knowledge must be represented by the
  graph
- Graph structures should be as simple as possible
- Purity of abstraction has its practical limits
- Multple perspectives on structures exists and is more common than exception
- Primarily porovide mechanisms, then provide convenience policies

# Disclaimer

Please, do no lament over the code. I am very well aware of what is in there and
how things should be or should not be. The code is just a reflection of
an exploration process where I am discovering how the structures for knowledge 
capture and for the derived linearized story telling should look like.

The code might or might not get better. It will either die of coplexity and
rot, or will be replaced by something fresh. Hard to tell right now.
