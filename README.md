# Data Tarot

A story-telling tool.

Currently developed together with Cards of Data Governance.

# Disclaimer

Do no lament over the code. I am very well aware of what is in there and how
things should be or should not be. The code is just a reflection of exploration
process where I am discovering how the infrastructure for interactiove card
story telling should look like.

The code contains tight coupling of models and infrastructure. There are places
where there is no clear distinction what belongs to the problem model and what
is its support.

The code might or might not get better. It will either die of coplexity and
rot, or will be replaced by something fresh. Hard to tell right now.
