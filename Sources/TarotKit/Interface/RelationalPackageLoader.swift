/// An object that loads a relational data source into a graph.
///
/// The source is set of relations â€“ tables, datasets, sets or collections
/// of records. A relation might either represent a collection of nodes or a
/// collection of links. Links can calso be represented by references between
/// records.
///
/// The data is stored in a directory package. Relations are stored in CSV
/// files. See ``RelationalPackage`` for more information.
///
///
/// ## Nodes
///
/// The loader will create a node for each record in the relation. The fields
/// will be preserved as node attributes with the same name.
/// The relation is expected to have one field that represents unique identifier
///
/// of the record. It is the _primary key_ field. This field will be used
/// to reference the created nodes during link creation. The default primary key
/// for a relation is `id`.
///
/// Relation with nodes might look like this:
///
/// | id | title | text |
/// | -- | ----- | ---- |
/// | 1 | Introduction | Once upon a time ... |
/// | 2 | Journey | They walked a lot ... |
/// | 3 | Crossroads | They had to split ... |
///
/// It can be described as:
///
/// ```swift
/// let chaptersRelation = NodeRelation(name: "chapters")
/// ```
///
/// Here is another relation containing cards that uses a different primary key:
///
/// | name | type | level |
/// | Aggregation | Capability | 2 |
/// | Automation | Capability | 2 |
/// | Adaptability | Indicator | 4 |
/// | Metrics | Artefact | 1 |
/// | Scheduling | Capability | 2 |
/// | Loading | Capability | 1 |
/// | Storage | Storage | 1 |
/// | Wild growth | Process | 4 |
///
/// ```swift
/// let cardsRelation = NodeRelation(
///     name: "cards",
///     primaryKey: "name"
/// )
/// ```

/// ## Links
///
/// There are two ways how the links are represented in the relational data
/// source. One way is through key field references, that is a relation might
/// contain fields that represent _foreign keys_. _Foreign key_ points to a
/// record in another relation. Another way of representation of liks is through
/// a links relation that desribes the links in more detail. The major
/// difference is, that the links created through foreign keys do not have
/// additional attributes. Links contained in a relation can have additional
/// attributes.
///
/// ### Links Relation
///
///Relation with links might look like this:
///
/// | origin | type | target |
/// | ------ | ---- | ------ |
/// | Aggregation | amplifies | Metrics |
/// | Automation | requires | Scheduling |
/// | Loading | requires | Storage |
/// | Wild Growth | inhibits | Adaptability |
///
/// The above example has two fields that form a link: `origin` for the link
/// origin and `target` for the link target. The remaining field `type` will
/// become link attribute.
///
/// Description of this link relation would be:
///
/// ```swift
/// let relation = LinkRelation(
///     name: "links",
///     originRelation: "cards"
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The field names for link _origin_ and _target_ can be chosen at will, but
/// they need to be explicitly specified in the relation description. For
/// example if we have fields `from` and `to` that reference other entities then
/// we would specify them as follows:
///
/// ```swift
/// let relation = LinkRelation(
///     name: "connections",
///     originRelation: "things",
///     originKey: "from",
///     targetKey: "to"
/// )
/// ```
///
/// See also: ``LinkRelation``.
///
/// ### Foreign Keys
///
/// Links can be also specified using _foreign keys_. A _foreign key_ is a field
/// that contains a reference to another relation. For example in the above
/// relation containing cards we have a field named `type` which might point
/// to another relation containing detailed description of types. If we want
/// to create links in the graph from nodes representing cards to nodes
/// representing their respective types, we can specify the relation like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// let cardsRelation = NodeRelation(
///     name: "cards",
///     primaryKey: "name",
///     foreignKeys: [
///         "type": "types"
///     ]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// This assumes that we have a relation with types:
///
/// | name | description |
/// | Capability | Ability that a system can do |
/// | Indicator | Measurable state of a system |
/// | Artefact | A product created by or in a system |
/// | Storage | Place where entities are stored |
/// | Process | Activity of a system |
///
/// ```swift
/// let typesRelation = NodeRelation(
///     name: "types",
///     primaryKey: "name"
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The links created using foreign keys have no attributes.
///
/// See also: ``NodeRelation``.
///
///
/// # Future Plans
///
/// In the future this class might be abstracted and broken into smaller parts:
/// `RelationalLoader` - loader of any relational data, `RelationalDataProvider`
/// - an abstract class for providing relational data, either from a file or
/// from a database.
///
