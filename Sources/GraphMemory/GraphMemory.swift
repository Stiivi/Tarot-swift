/// Graph Memory is a mutable graph container. It contains nodes and links and
/// provides functionality for modifying the graph.
///
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let memory = GraphMemory()
///
/// let parent = Node()
/// memory.add(parent)
///
/// let leftChild = Node()
/// memory.add(leftChild)
/// memory.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "left")
///
/// let rightChild = Node()
/// memory.add(rightChild)
/// memory.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "right")
/// ```
///
/// - Remark: For engineers out there: This is a "domain specific problem environment object", or a
/// "simulation environment". It is not made a generic as it is not intended
/// for general purpose use. It does not mean it might not change in the future.
